# RAG Systems: An Introduction

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models (LLMs) by providing them with external knowledge. This allows the models to generate more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Indexing Phase**:
   - Documents are processed and split into chunks
   - Each chunk is embedded into a vector using an embedding model
   - The vectors are stored in a vector database

2. **Retrieval Phase**:
   - When a query comes in, it is embedded using the same embedding model
   - Similar vectors are retrieved from the database
   - The retrieved texts serve as context for the question

3. **Generation Phase**:
   - The LLM receives both the query and the retrieved context
   - It generates a response based on the question and the context

## Benefits of RAG

- **Reduced Hallucination**: By providing external knowledge, RAG helps reduce the model's tendency to make up information
- **Up-to-date Information**: RAG can incorporate the latest information from documents that weren't part of the model's training data
- **Verifiability**: Responses can be traced back to their source documents
- **Domain Specialization**: Models can be specialized for specific domains without retraining

## Common Use Cases

- Question answering over specific documents
- Customer support chatbots with access to product documentation
- Research assistants that can analyze scientific papers
- Legal and compliance applications working with regulatory documents
